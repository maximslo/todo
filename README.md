# 📝 To-Do App

My first full stack web application, this was the coding challenge for joining Hack4Impact's Impact Team. 

A simple checklist with form input for users to add and remove items which persist on the page after a refresh. Backend done with Flask-PyMongo and a Mongo Atlas database that stores items, even if not running. Frontend done with Bootstrap. Learned a lot about venvs, routing, methods, and normalize.css.
